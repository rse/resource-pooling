About
-----

This is a small Node.js library for simple resource pooling. The
resource can be an arbitrary object and usually is something like a
database connection.

Application Programming Interface
---------------------------------

The API of Resource-Pooling is a superset of the `Set` API:

- `constructor(): Pool`:<br/>

- `Pool#add(resource: any): Pool`:<br/>

- `Pool#remove(resource: any): Pool`:<br/>

- `Pool#clear(): Pool`:<br/>

- `Pool#has(resource: any): boolean`:<br/>

- `Pool#size(): number`:<br/>

- `Pool#values(): any[]`:<br/>

- `Pool#forEach(callback: (resource: any) => void): Pool`:<br/>

- `Pool#acquire(retries?: number, delay?: number): Promise<any>`:<br/>

- `Pool#release(resource: any): Pool`:<br/>

- `Pool#used(resource: any): boolean`:<br/>

- `Pool#use(callback: (resource: any) => Promise<any>, retries?: number, delay?: number): Promise<any>`:<br/>

- `Pool#drain(callback: (resource: any) => Promise<any>, retries?: number, delay?: number): Pool`:<br/>
